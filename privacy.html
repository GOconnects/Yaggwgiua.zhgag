        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> March 16, 2025</p>
        
        <p>At <strong>GO Connects</strong>, we are committed to transparency and your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we operate and what you can expect when using our service.</p>
        
        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>GO Connects does not directly collect, store, or process personal information from users.</strong> However, our platform uses third-party services (such as Google AdSense) that may collect data for advertising purposes:<br><br>
            - <strong>Cookies & Tracking:</strong> Third-party advertisers (like Google) may use cookies or similar technologies to personalize ads based on your browsing behavior. These practices are governed by their own privacy policies.<br>
            - <strong>Anonymous Analytics:</strong> We may use tools like Google Analytics to analyze traffic, but this data is aggregated and anonymized.
        </p>
        
        <h2>2. How We Operate</h2>
        <p>
            - <strong>Service Description:</strong> GO Connects acts as a bridge between users and third-party scholarship or academic service providers. We do not require personal information to facilitate these connections.<br>
            - <strong>Third-Party Links & Ads:</strong> Our platform may include links to external websites or display ads via Google AdSense. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these third parties. Review their policies (<a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank">Google AdSense</a>) before engaging.
        </p>
        
        <h2>3. Data Security</h2>
        <p>Since we do not collect personal information, there is no risk of data breaches through our platform. However, third-party services (e.g., advertisers) have their own security measures.</p>
        
        <h2>4. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>
            - <strong>Opt-Out of Tracking:</strong> You can disable cookies in your browser settings or opt out of personalized ads via <a href="https://adssettings.google.com/" target="_blank">Google's Ad Settings</a>.<br>
            - <strong>GDPR/CCPA:</strong> If you are in the EU or California, you may have additional rights regarding third-party data collection. Contact us at <a href="mailto:globalopportunityconnects@gmail.com">globalopportunityconnects@gmail.com</a> for questions.
        </p>
        
        <h2>5. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. Changes will be posted here with the updated "Last Updated" date. Continued use of the service constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.</p>
